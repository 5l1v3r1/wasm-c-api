Work in progress. No docs yet.

* C API:

  * See `example/hello.c` for example usage.

  * See `include/wasm.h` for interface.

* C++ API:

  * See `example/hello.cc` for example usage.

  * See `include/wasm.hh` for interface.

* A half-complete implementation based on V8 is in `src`.

* C API is build on top of C++ API.
